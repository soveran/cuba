Description
-----------

Cuba is a microframework for web development originally inspired by [Rum][rum],
a tiny but powerful mapper for [Rack][rack] applications.

It integrates many templates via [Tilt][tilt], and testing via
[Cutest][cutest] and [Capybara][capybara].

Usage
-----

Here's a simple application:

``` ruby
# cat hello_world.rb
require "cuba"

Cuba.use Rack::Session::Cookie

Cuba.define do
  on get do
    on "hello" do
      res.write "Hello world!"
    end

    on true do
      res.redirect "/hello"
    end
  end
end

# cat hello_world_test.rb
require "cuba/test"

scope do
  test "Homepage" do
    visit "/"
    assert has_content?("Hello world!")
  end
end
```

To run it, you can create a `config.ru` file:

``` ruby
# cat config.ru
require "./hello_world"

run Cuba
```

You can now run `rackup` and enjoy what you have just created.

Matchers
--------

Here's an example showcasing how different matchers work:

``` ruby
require "cuba"

Cuba.use Rack::Session::Cookie

Cuba.define do

  # only GET requests
  on get do

    # /
    on "" do
      res.write "Home"
    end

    # /about
    on "about" do
      res.write "About"
    end

    # /styles/basic.css
    on "styles", extension("css") do |file|
      res.write "Filename: #{file}" #=> "Filename: basic"
    end

    # /post/2011/02/16/hello
    on "post/:y/:m/:d/:slug" do |y, m, d, slug|
      res.write "#{y}-#{m}-#{d} #{slug}" #=> "2011-02-16 hello"
    end

    # /username/foobar
    on "username/:username" do |username|

      user = User.find_by_username(username) # username == "foobar"

      # /username/foobar/posts
      on "posts" do

        # You can access `user` here, because the `on` blocks
        # are closures.
        res.write "Total Posts: #{user.posts.size}" #=> "Total Posts: 6"
      end

      # /username/foobar/following
      on "following" do
        res.write user.following.size #=> "1301"
      end
    end

    # /search?q=barbaz
    on "search", param("q") do |query|
      res.write "Searched for #{query}" #=> "Searched for barbaz"
    end
  end

  # only POST requests
  on post do
    on "login"

      # POST /login, user: foo, pass: baz
      on param("user"), param("pass") do |user, pass|
        res.write "#{user}:#{pass}" #=> "foo:baz"
      end

      # If the params `user` and `pass` are not provided, this block will
      # get executed.
      on true do
        res.write "You need to provide user and pass!"
      end
    end
  end
end
```


HTTP Verbs
----------

There are four matchers defined for HTTP Verbs: `get`, `post`, `put` and
`delete`. But the world doesn't end there, does it? As you have the whole
request available via the `req` object, you can query it with helper methods
like `req.options?` or `req.head?`, or you can even go to a lower level
and inspect the environment via the `env` object, and check for example if
`env["REQUEST_METHOD"]` equals the obscure verb `PATCH`.

What follows is an example of different ways of saying the same thing:

``` ruby
on env["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "GET", "api" do ... end

on req.get?, "api" do ... end

on get, "api" do ... end
```

Actually, `get` is syntax sugar for `req.get?`, which in turn is syntax sugar
for `env["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "GET"`.

Captures
--------

You may have noticed that some matchers yield a value to the block. The rules
for determining if a matcher will yield a value are simple:

1. Regex captures: `"posts/(\d+)-(.*)"` will yield two values, corresponding to each capture.
2. Placeholders: `"users/:id"` will yield the value in the position of :id.
3. Symbols: `:foobar` will yield if a segment is available.
4. File extensions: `extension("css")` will yield the basename of the matched file.
5. Parameters: `param("user")` will yield the value of the parameter user, if present.

The first case is important because it shows the underlying effect of regex
captures.

In the second case, the substring `:id` gets replaced by `([^\\/]+)` and the
string becomes `"users/([^\\/]+)"` before performing the match, thus it reverts
to the first form we saw.

In the third case, the symbol ––no matter what it says––gets replaced
by `"([^\\/]+)"`, and again we are in presence of case 1.

The fourth case, again, reverts to the basic matcher: it generates the string
`"([^\\/]+?)\.#{ext}\\z"` before performing the match.

The fifth case is different: it checks if the the parameter supplied is present
in the request (via POST or QUERY_STRING) and it pushes the value as a capture.

Composition
-----------

You can mount a Cuba app, along with middlewares, inside another Cuba app:

``` ruby
API = Cuba.build

API.use SomeMiddleware

API.define do
  on param("url") do |url|
    ...
  end
end

Cuba.define do
  on "api" do
    run API
  end
end
```

Testing
-------

Given that Cuba is essentially Rack, it is very easy to test with `Webrat` or
`Capybara`. Cuba's own tests are written with a combination of [Cutest][cutest]
and [Capybara][capybara], and if you want to use the same for your tests it is
as easy as requiring `cuba/test`:

``` ruby
require "cuba/test"
require "your/app"

scope do
  test "Homepage" do
    visit "/"

    assert has_content?("Hello world!")
  end
end
```

[Capybara][capybara].

Installation
------------

``` ruby
$ gem install cuba
```
